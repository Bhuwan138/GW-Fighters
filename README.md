With the motto of making people aware of Earth's changing climate, we have made a web app using HTML, CSS, and JS.



Our project revolves around the Mississippi River Delta. By utilizing the data collected by NASA's Delta-X mission, we have made a single-page web app that shows how climate change has affected the Mississippi River. We have also studied the causes of huge landmass loss in the delta region. 



Basically, our website tries to summarize the data collected in the Delta-X mission. Anyone who lands on our website will get to know about the Delta-X mission, the reasons for the growing and sinking of the landmass in different regions, and how climate change triggered these phenomena. For instance, we have given a timeline from starting of the Delta-X mission to its end. Anyone coming to our website can know a lot about the mission at a glance.



In the future, we hope to display all the data we have collected from NASA and various other sources dynamically using graphics and animations so that anyone visiting our website can easily understand all the complicated data collected by NASA. Furthermore, we are hoping to use Artificial Intelligence in order to predict possible areas where there is a probability of flood. We are also looking forward to finding various ways to slow down this huge landmass loss.
